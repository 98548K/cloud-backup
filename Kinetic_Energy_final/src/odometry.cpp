Fundamental odom math and updating math. Delta math formula is: delta value = value - previous value.
This is so we can solve for the original value, then add the diference between
where it was and where it's at using the formula. As Chris would put it, "So basically what you're saying
is that subtracting the previous values from the current values gives us the difference in where it is and where it's been,
so we can then add those to where it currently is and get the correct value."
